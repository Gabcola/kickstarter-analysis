# kickstarter-analysis

## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
* The purpose of this analysis is to get the outcomes based on goals and outcomes based on launch date


## Analysis and Challenges: Explain how you performed your analysis using images and links to code, as well as any challenges you encountered and how you overcame them. If you had no challenges, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be encountered.

* In the analysis of outcomes by launch date, I start of creating a pivot table based on data in Kickstarter spreadsheet.  Then I created a chart based on pivot table info. In the analysis of outcomes based on goals, I first created a table with numbers I need (use countifs and sum function), then I created a pivot chart to reflect those numbers. 
I don’t have challenges. I guess the possible difficulties would be the countifs function, any typo may make the formula not working well. I did have few typo which causing the issue to run formula. But overall it’s all good. 

## Results: Answer the following questions in complete and coherent sentences.
### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?

* First, overall there are more successful theater event than the failure ones.  The pivot chart shows the successful line all above the failed line. 
Second, pre summer time(May-June) would be the best time to hose theater event. 

### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
* There may be the outlier in the goal of 30,000 to 40,000. Overall, the goal and percentage failed in the positive correlation, the larger the goal is, the more chance the outcome would failed. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90543647/138780434-629f05fe-acf4-49e3-a748-5fe3b7a7fc87.png)
